# FaculTrack
FaculTrack simplifies faculty self-appraisals with secure login, automated research tracking, and academic logging. It generates PDFs and allows admins to manage and sort submissions. Integrated with Google Drive, it organizes uploaded files in faculty-specific folders, saving folder links in the database.
